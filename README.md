Hello! Here are the step-by-step instructions on how to set up Save Our City on your device.
  1. Find the following files in the github (They should all be in the SoC_Game_Files folder):
    MonoBleedingEdge (folder)
    Save our City_Data (folder)
    Save our City.exe
    UnityCrashHandler32.exe
    UnityPlayer.dll
  2. Download (or copy/paste) those files (they should be the only ones you need) to a location of your choice.
  3. Make sure you have two displays available (for example, a laptop with an HDMI cord to a projector). 
    Here is a helpful link to follow (set the “Multiple Displays” dropdown to extend): Set up dual monitors on Windows (microsoft.com) 
    (Advanced: if you want to see both displays on the same screen, you will likely need to set up a virtual desktop.)
  4. Double click on the “Save our City.exe” file in the file folder, and the game should pop up. 
    IMPORTANT: I forgot to make an elegant way to leave/exit the game until now (pretty big oversight, apologies). 
    My temporary solution is for the GM to hold the Escape (ESC) key for 5-10 seconds, and the application will quit.
  5. Any data saved in the game should appear in your Downloads folder.
Let me know if you have questions, or if any steps are not working.
